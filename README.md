# Business & Marketing Plan
Create a website that provides a direct connection between recruiters and HBCU athletes. The website  also provides athletes with the option to display their talent. Athletes can upload player statistics and film that recruiters will have direct access to. Athletes will also be provided with the option to upload a quick  video introducing themselves on their profile. This gives players the opportunity to gain recruiters attention by showing them not only are they good on the field, but they are a well- rounded individual.

* This networking opportunity will provide student-athletes with more recognition during their collegagic career. Creating a website is the most efficient choice to benefit the end users. Websites are accessible from most internet browsers, and would provide this service with the most amount of users possible. If we were to create a mobile application, this would restrict the amount of users we would have. If the developers want to make the most out of the amount of users their application is compatible with, they will need to develop the application on multiple platforms. This has more cost associated with it and takes more time. It is more efficient to create a website and ensure that the website is mobile friendly than to only create a mobile application. The website has different criteria in order for it to function correctly. 

* The first criteria set in place is to ensure the website has two different accounts that can be signed into by end users which we call portals. One portal is for the student athletes, the other portal is for the recruiters. Once they select if they are a student athlete or a recruiter, the website will take them to the correct portal. This is done through the use of a conditional statement. 

* Conditional statements are used throughout the website to get end users to the portion of the website they need to go to. Another criteria this website has is the ability for each user to create and edit their own accounts. Student athlete accounts will allow users to upload all of their information to their page. This includes film, statistics, experience, and a short introduction video. Athletes will also be able to provide information like where they are from and age in their biography section. Recruiter accounts will allow users to view student athlete profiles.

* Users will be able to filter search different players and positions depending on what they are recruiting for. Recruiters will be able to like and favorite player profiles so that they can come back to them later. This website has similar characteristics to Linkedin because it provides exposure to individuals seeking a certain role. This service differs from Linkedin because users on Linkedin have to search for other users' names to find an individual and what experience they have. Our website gives recruiters direct access to student athletes based on their search criteria.


* Student athletes will also be able to upload their resumes to their profiles so student athletes can show that they are just as talented in the classroom as they are on the field or on the court. This also gives professional athletes a chance to potentially find a job. The people running the website will be current juniors, seniors, and grad students in business, marketing, communications, finance, and computer science.Alumni will also be running this website. Upperclassmen, grad students, and alumni will all have administrative access to this website to maintain the website and make constant updates.
